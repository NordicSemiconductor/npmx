# Changelog
All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-xx-xx
### Changed
- `npmx_charger_charging_current_get` and `npmx_charger_charging_current_set` now uses microamperes instead of milliamperes in order to support the more fine-grained adjustment options for nPM1304.
- Allowed values for `npmx_charger_discharging_current_set` is updated to be aligned with nPM1300 Product Specification v1.2. There are now only two allowed values: 200 mA and 1000 mA (low and high limits).
- `npmx_charger_discharging_current_set` no longer returns NPMX_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED when used with nPM1304 (which only has a single allowed battery discharge limit value).
- nPM1300 battery current calculation updated to be aligned with nPM1300 Product Specification v1.2.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-28
### Fixed
 - Fixed offset issue in npmx_adc_meas_all_get.
 - Fixed -Wdouble-promotion build warnings.

### Added
 - Added support for nPM1304 PMIC.

### Changed
- npmx_adc ibat measurement is now reported in microamperes instead of milliamperes.
- NPMX_ADC_IBAT_MEAS_CURRENT_RFU member removed from npmx_adc_ibat_meas_current_t enum.

## [1.0.1] - 2024-07-12
### Fixed
 - Corrected discharge fullscale current.
 - Corrected charge fullscale current.
 - Update current limit on set.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-12-01
### Added
 - Added ADK v1.4.0.
 - Added the `npmx_adc_ntc_config_t` structure to the ADC driver. The structure contains a thermistor type and NTC beta value.
 - Added `npmx_charger_*_temperature_*` functions for getting and setting NTC temperature threshold using temperature in degrees Celsius.
 - Added the `restore_values` initialization parameter to the `npmx_core_init` function. Now, the following values can be restored from a PMIC device during its initialization: ADC burst mode enable, NTC beta value, charging current, discharging current, and ship button inversion status.
 - Added mathematical functions used in npmx to `npmx_common`.

### Changed
 - Changed the temperature type in the `npmx_charger_die_temp_*` functions. Now they accept negative values.
 - Changed a function for setting and reading the NTC type in the ADC driver. Now the `npmx_adc_ntc_config_t` configuration structure is passed as an argument to `npmx_adc_ntc_config_*` functions.
 - Changed the NTC resistance calculation to the battery temperature calculation in the ADC driver. The `NPMX_ADC_MEAS_NTC` enumeration which used to return measurement in Ohms has been replaced by `NPMX_ADC_MEAS_BAT_TEMP` which returns temperature in millidegrees Celsius.
 - Changed a behavior of the `npmx_timer_config_set` function. Now it triggers the `NPMX_TIMER_TASK_STROBE` task after setting the configuration.
 - Changed a compilation define that should be used when building for nPM1300 from `NPM1300_ENG_C` to `NPM1300`.
 - Changed the template file name for nPM1300 from `templates/npmx_config_npm1300_eng_c.h` to `templates/npmx_config_npm1300.h`.
 - Changed the behavior of the `npmx_callback_to_str` and `npmx_callback_bit_to_str` functions. Now, strings will be returned instead of a NULL pointer when building with `NPMX_DEBUG` defined.
 - Changed values in the `npmx_ldsw_soft_start_current_t`.

### Fixed
 - Fixed an issue in the `npmx_ldsw_soft_start_config_get` function that caused an incorrect enable state.
 - Fixed an issue in the `npmx_charger_die_temp_*` functions that caused incorrect temperature calculations in the charger driver.
 - Fixed an issue with the `NPMX_ADC_MEAS_BAT_TEMP` parameter in the `npmx_adc_meas_get` function. The issue caused an inaccurate die temperature calculation in the charger driver.
 - Fixed an issue in the `npmx_adc_meas_get` and `npmx_adc_meas_all_get` functions that caused an incorrect value to be returned.
 - Fixed an issue in the `npmx_callback_bit_to_str` function that caused an incorrect string description to be returned.
 - Fixed an issue in the `npmx_ship_reset_config_set` function that caused an incorrect task to be called.
 - Fixed minor issues in documentation.
