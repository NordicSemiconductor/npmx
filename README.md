# npmx
## Overview
npmx is a set of drivers for peripherals present in Nordic Semiconductor's Power Management ICs (PMICs).

For the user's convenience, the drivers come with the ADK package. This package contains definitions of register structures and bitfields for PMICs.

A comprehensive set of [Zephyr samples](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/npmx-zephyr) using this library are also available.
